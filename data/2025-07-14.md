### [1] [RepeaTTS: Towards Feature Discovery through Repeated Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08012)
*Atli Sigurgeirsson,Simon King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示的文本转语音模型，通过自然语言指令控制语音的多种特征，并探讨了一种新的微调方法以提高模型的可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的文本转语音模型在控制语音特征时存在局限性，要么受限于训练时暴露的声学特征，要么因输入相同而产生不可控的变异性。

Method: 通过主成分分析确定潜在特征，并将其作为新标签进行二次微调，以提高模型的可控性。

Result: 在未包含情感披露的冰岛语语音模型上，该方法成功提取了连续和离散特征，显著提升了模型的可控性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了模型在控制性和灵活性之间的矛盾，为语音合成领域提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedicalBERT是一种针对生物医学领域的预训练BERT模型，通过优化和微调在多项任务中表现优于其他BERT模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献的领域特定术语对现有NLP模型（如BERT、GPT）提出了挑战，需要一种能更好理解生物医学术语的模型。

Method: 提出MedicalBERT，基于BERT架构，使用大规模生物医学数据集预训练，并优化微调以处理多种任务。

Result: MedicalBERT在多项任务中表现优于BioBERT、SciBERT等模型，平均比通用BERT模型提升5.67%。

Conclusion: MedicalBERT展示了预训练BERT模型在生物医学NLP任务中的潜力，验证了迁移学习在捕获领域特定信息方面的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question
answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics
such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as
BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost
of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on
average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores
the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques incapturing
domain-specific information.

### [3] [Mass-Scale Analysis of In-the-Wild Conversations Reveals Complexity Bounds on LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08014)
*Aldan Creo,Raul Castro Fernandez,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过对200多万条真实对话的大规模分析，发现越狱攻击的复杂性并未显著高于正常对话，且攻击复杂性和毒性保持稳定，而AI的防御机制在改进。研究挑战了攻防升级的叙事，指出人类创造力的限制可能为AI安全设定了自然边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，理解越狱攻击的复杂性及其演变对AI安全至关重要。

Method: 研究分析了来自不同平台的200多万条真实对话，使用概率度量、词汇多样性、压缩比和认知负荷指标等多种复杂性指标。

Result: 越狱攻击的复杂性并未显著高于正常对话，攻击复杂性和毒性保持稳定，而AI的防御机制在改进。复杂性分布未呈现幂律特征，表明越狱攻击存在自然限制。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了攻防升级的叙事，指出人类创造力的限制可能为AI安全设定了自然边界，并警示了学术披露可能带来的信息风险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

### [4] [Assessing the Capabilities and Limitations of FinGPT Model in Financial NLP Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08015)
*Prudence Djagba,Chimezie A. Odinakachukwu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinGPT在金融领域NLP任务中表现优异，尤其在分类任务（如情感分析）上接近GPT-4，但在推理和生成任务（如问答和摘要）上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域NLP任务中的实际能力与局限性，为未来研究提供基准。

Method: 在六个金融NLP任务（如情感分析、股票预测等）上测试FinGPT，并与GPT-4和人类基准对比。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现强，但在推理任务中表现不佳，与GPT-4存在明显差距。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但需改进架构和领域优化以实现更全面的能力。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

### [5] [Mechanistic Indicators of Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08017)
*Pierre Beckmann,Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的内部工作机制，提出了一个三层级的机器理解理论，并指出LLMs的理解方式与人类不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战LLMs仅依赖表面统计数据的观点，探索其内部结构与人类理解的相似性。

Method: 提出三层级的机器理解理论：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则性理解，并分析LLMs的内部机制。

Result: LLMs通过形成潜在空间中的特征和连接事实的“电路”展现出理解能力，但其认知架构与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应关注LLMs的独特工作机制，而非争论其是否理解。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

### [6] [Review, Remask, Refine (R3): Process-Guided Block Diffusion for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08018)
*Nikita Mounier,Parsa Idehpour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R3框架通过Review、Remask、Refine三步优化文本生成，无需额外训练，适用于预训练掩码文本扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决迭代文本生成中模型难以高效识别和修正自身错误的问题。

Method: 利用Process Reward Model（PRM）评估生成块，根据PRM分数动态掩码低分块，并强制模型优化这些部分。

Result: 通过针对性优化，提升了最终生成文本的质量。

Conclusion: R3是一种简单有效的框架，显著改进了文本生成的错误修正能力。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

### [7] [Signal or Noise? Evaluating Large Language Models in Resume Screening Across Contextual Variations and Human Expert Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08019)
*Aryan Varshney,Venkat Ram Reddy Ganuthula*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在简历筛选中的一致性行为与随机差异，并与人类专家比较。结果显示LLMs在不同情境下表现显著差异，且与人类评价有明显不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在简历筛选中的表现是否一致，以及其与人类专家的差异，为自动化招聘系统提供参考。

Method: 使用三个LLMs（Claude、GPT和Gemini）和人类专家在四种情境下测试，通过方差分析和配对t检验比较表现。

Result: LLMs在不同情境下表现显著差异，GPT适应性强，Gemini部分适应，Claude适应性弱，且所有LLMs与人类专家评价显著不同。

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下表现可解释，但与人类判断差异显著，需谨慎用于自动化招聘。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

### [8] [Circumventing Safety Alignment in Large Language Models Through Embedding Space Toxicity Attenuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08020)
*Zhibo Zhang,Yuxi Li,Kailong Wang,Shuai Yuan,Ling Shi,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换识别并减弱嵌入空间中毒敏感维度，成功攻击多个开源LLM，揭示当前对齐策略的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在多个领域取得成功，但其开放性带来安全风险，尤其是嵌入空间中毒攻击。现有研究对LLM安全对齐的动态理解不足，缺乏针对性攻击技术的研究。

Method: 提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换识别并减弱嵌入空间中的毒性敏感维度，无需微调模型或访问训练数据。

Result: 在五个开源LLM上测试，ETTA平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%，且在安全增强模型上表现良好（77.39% ASR）。

Conclusion: ETTA揭示了当前对齐策略的关键漏洞，强调需要嵌入感知的防御措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

### [9] [Unveiling Effective In-Context Configurations for Image Captioning: An External & Internal Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08021)
*Li Li,Yongliang Wu,Jingze Zhu,Jiawei Peng,Jianfei Cai,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过外部和内部实验全面研究了多模态上下文学习（ICL）在图像描述任务中的应用，探索了演示配置策略和模型注意力特性，并提出了新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大型语言模型（LLMs）成功的启发，研究者开发了具有ICL能力的大型多模态模型（LMMs），但对多模态ICL的演示配置研究仍处于初步阶段。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过外部实验探索演示配置策略（如样本数量、图像检索和标题分配），并通过内部实验分析LMM的注意力特性，提出基于注意力的指标。

Result: 研究发现ICEs配置策略显著影响模型性能，并揭示了LMM的典型注意力模式。此外，辅助实验验证了注意力驱动的模型加速和压缩的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文通过双重视角（外部和内部）理解多模态ICL，提出的方法和指标可应用于更广泛的研究领域。

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

### [10] ["Amazing, They All Lean Left" -- Analyzing the Political Temperaments of Current LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08027)
*W. Russell Neuman,Chad Coleman,Ali Dasdan,Safinah Ali,Manan Shah,Kund Meghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现多数商业大语言模型（LLM）在伦理和政治回应中表现出一致的自由主义倾向，原因包括训练数据、强化学习、学术伦理框架和安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM政治倾向的成因及其影响，区分政治偏见与合理认知差异。

Method: 使用道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和争议指数，分析七种主流LLM。

Result: 多数模型优先考虑自由主义价值观（如关怀与公平），微调进一步强化此倾向。

Conclusion: 自由主义倾向是训练数据的自然结果，可能反映集体道德推理，而非编程偏见。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

### [11] [Better Together: Quantifying the Benefits of AI-Assisted Recruitment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08029)
*Ada Aka,Emil Palikot,Ali Ansari,Nima Yazdani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI辅助招聘显著提升候选人通过率和就业概率，但倾向于选择年轻且经验较少的申请人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化AI在招聘中对效率和候选人选择的影响。

Method: 随机分配37,000名申请人至传统或AI辅助招聘流程，比较结果。

Result: AI组通过率提高20个百分点，就业概率高5.9个百分点，但偏向年轻、经验少的候选人。

Conclusion: AI影响招聘决策，但需注意其潜在偏见。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

### [12] [A Systematic Analysis of Declining Medical Safety Messaging in Generative AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08030)
*Sonali Sharma,Ahmed M. Alaa,Roxana Daneshjou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了2022至2025年间生成式AI模型（LLM和VLM）输出中医疗免责声明的存在情况，发现其比例显著下降，2025年多数模型已无免责声明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型在医疗领域的应用日益广泛，但其输出可能存在不准确性，免责声明作为安全措施至关重要。

Method: 使用500份乳腺X光片、500份胸部X光片、500份皮肤病图像和500个医学问题，筛选模型输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: LLM和VLM输出的免责声明比例从2022年的26.3%和2023年的19.6%分别降至2025年的0.97%和1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着模型能力的提升，免责声明应根据临床情境动态调整，以确保安全性。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

*Hong Jia,Shiya Fu,Vassilis Kostakos,Feng Xia,Ting Dang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs在心理健康理解任务中表现接近LLMs，尤其在二元分类任务中差距仅2%，且通过少量样本学习能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SLMs作为隐私保护工具在敏感应用中的潜力，特别是在心理健康领域的理解能力。

Method: 采用零样本和少量样本学习范式，评估五种SLMs与三种LLMs在六项心理健康任务中的表现。

Result: SLMs在二元分类任务中表现接近LLMs（F1分数0.64 vs 0.66），多分类任务中性能下降相似。少量样本学习对SLMs提升显著（达14.6%）。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，适合作为隐私保护工具，尤其在少量样本学习下表现突出。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

### [14] [Integrating External Tools with Large Language Models to Improve Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08034)
*Nripesh Niketan,Hadj Batatia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，通过集成外部工具增强LLM在教育场景中的查询能力，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM缺乏上下文信息时表现不佳，需要外部工具提供实时数据和计算能力。

Method: 开发框架集成外部API，支持获取额外信息和计算功能。

Result: 在MMLU数据集上，Athena框架数学推理准确率83%，科学推理88%，优于GPT-4o等模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建围绕LLM的复杂计算生态系统铺平道路，支持多样化任务。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

TL;DR: 该研究系统回顾了68篇关于医学视觉问答（MedVQA）的文献，并调查了50名临床医生，发现MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际效用有限，主要问题包括数据集和模型的不足以及评价指标与临床需求的不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际应用价值，识别其挑战和差距。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献回顾和临床医生调查。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图、多分辨率成像等关键功能，且评价指标与临床需求不匹配。临床医生中仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用。

Conclusion: MedVQA具有潜力，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景和评价方法不匹配等问题，以实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

TL;DR: CRISP是一个多领域数据集，用于提升LLM的高层次计划生成能力，通过微调小模型显著优于少样本提示和大模型的CoT推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设LLM仅通过少样本提示即可生成有效计划，但实际能力不足，需验证和改进。

Method: 引入CRISP数据集，自动生成并验证高层次计划，通过微调小模型提升计划质量。

Result: 微调后的小模型生成计划质量优于大模型和CoT推理，且具有跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: CRISP验证了微调对计划生成的有效性，展示了跨领域泛化的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

TL;DR: AblationBench是一个用于评估语言模型代理在消融实验规划任务中表现的基准套件，包含两个任务：AuthorAblation和ReviewerAblation。实验表明，当前前沿语言模型在这些任务上表现有限，最佳系统仅能识别29%的原始消融实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型代理在科研领域的应用增多，设计消融实验成为关键。AblationBench旨在评估代理在消融实验规划任务中的能力，填补这一研究空白。

Method: AblationBench包含两个任务：AuthorAblation（基于方法部分提出消融实验）和ReviewerAblation（在完整论文中找出缺失的消融实验）。使用语言模型作为自动评估框架。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前前沿语言模型在这些任务上表现不佳，最佳系统平均仅识别29%的原始消融实验。思维链提示优于现有代理方法。

Conclusion: AblationBench为评估语言模型代理在消融实验规划任务中的表现提供了基准，并揭示了当前模型的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul是一个多轮对话LLM推理系统，通过动态选择压缩策略和优化恢复流程，显著减少了KV缓存的存储和恢复时间，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话中高效恢复状态是一个关键挑战，现有固定压缩策略忽略了对话特定的注意力动态，导致准确性下降。

Method: Krul动态选择压缩策略，引入预压缩策略选择器、注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器。

Result: Krul在真实任务中实现了1.5x-2.68x的TTFT减少和1.33x-2.35x的KV缓存存储减少。

Conclusion: Krul通过动态策略和优化流程，显著提升了多轮对话的效率和质量。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调、基于大语言模型的方法，用于从自然语言问题或关键词查询生成SPARQL查询，并在多种知识图谱和语言模型上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的挑战，避免对模型进行微调，同时探索知识图谱的潜力。

Method: 利用语言模型通过策略性执行SPARQL查询搜索相关IRIs和字面量，无需微调。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到零样本设置的SOTA结果，在Freebase上接近最佳少样本方法，其他知识图谱上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种场景下表现优异，且通过额外研究验证了其灵活性和扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型（LM）能加速文本处理任务，但其实际应用受限于安全性、可解释性和偏见问题。研究旨在负责任地利用LM，减少风险，让人类专家专注于决策而非数据处理或提示工程。

Method: 提出一个框架，声明静态类型的LM子程序，记录所有LM生成的工件（如提示、输入、输出和数据依赖），并支持按需审计。框架实现为一个库，并在公共评论处理（如NEPA）中应用。

Result: 开发了“CommentNEPA”应用，用于编译、组织和总结公共评论。定量评估显示，其输出与人工标注的历史“真实”数据相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架为LM的透明、可审计使用提供了可行方案，适用于多个决策工作流（如医疗和法律领域），并在公共评论处理中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

*Vivek Chari,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数、不依赖查询的KV缓存压缩方法，通过近似杠杆分数确定token重要性，显著减少内存占用，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中KV缓存内存占用高的问题，以提高吞吐量和降低服务成本。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数进行token重要性评估，提出上下文校准压缩策略。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中，Compactor保留一半token，内存负担减少63%，性能与竞争方法相当。

Conclusion: Compactor是一种高效、通用的KV缓存压缩方法，适用于多种任务和模型。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从大型语言模型（LLM）到小型语言模型（SLM）的知识蒸馏方法，重点保留LLM中的共情能力，通过两步微调过程和针对性提示显著提升SLM的共情表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限但需要频繁人机交互的场景（如智能手机）中，确保SLM在蒸馏后仍能保留LLM的共情能力至关重要。

Method: 采用两步微调过程，利用从LLM蒸馏出的共情对话数据集，并设计了四组针对性提示以优化共情蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明，经过该方法训练的SLM在生成共情回应时胜率高达90%，针对性提示比基础直接提示胜率提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLM的共情能力，为资源受限场景下的高质量人机交互提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM为真实性预测提供了全面且可扩展的工具，促进了该领域的研究和应用。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究OOCR现象的机制，解释为什么微调后的LLMs能表现出超出分布的泛化能力。

Method: 通过LoRA微调分析OOCR，并训练转向向量验证其作用。

Result: 发现恒定转向向量足以解释OOCR现象，甚至在模型后门任务中也适用。

Conclusion: 揭示了微调过程中学习的内容，为LLMs的安全可靠部署提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能准确模拟真实学生的行为和特征，为智能辅导系统和测试问题开发提供依据。

Method: 收集489项NAEP数据，应用IRT模型将11种LLMs与真实学生能力对标。

Result: 强模型普遍优于学生，弱模型可能偶然对齐；提示调整影响表现，但无模型-提示组合能完全匹配各年级和学科。

Conclusion: 需新训练和评估策略，并提供了选择可行代理的指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Motivation: 解决推理密集型任务中过度思考的问题，提升模型的效率和可控性。

Method: 采用自动思维训练范式，包括双机制数据集构建、多令牌预测增强的知识蒸馏、冷启动初始化策略和Step-SRPO强化学习算法。

Result: KAT在多个基准测试中表现优异，减少token使用约30%，并在实际应用中提升了开发效率。

Conclusion: KAT展示了AutoThink范式的可扩展性，未来通过更大规模的模型有望进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像任务中表现优异，但在跨模态和跨语言的文档图像机器翻译任务中存在能力遗忘问题。

Method: 引入SSR范式，模型在生成翻译文本前先生成OCR文本，利用其单语OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译学习。

Result: 实验表明SSR能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升模型在OCR和DIMT任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR是一种有效的微调方法，能够同时保持模型的OCR能力和提升翻译能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

TL;DR: CRMAgent是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，通过三种模式生成高质量的消息模板和写作指导，显著提升电商私域渠道的营销效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商私域渠道中，多数商家因缺乏专业知识和工具而难以撰写有说服力的内容，CRMAgent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CRMAgent采用三种模式：基于群组的学习、检索与适配、基于规则的备用方案，以优化消息模板。

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果指标上均优于商家原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent为商家提供了可扩展的工具，显著提升了私域渠道的营销效果。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

TL;DR: MK2提出了一种基于提示的轻量级方法，通过迭代优化提示生成专利产品创意，无需额外训练数据，在多个领域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决将专利转化为三年内可行的产品创意的任务，探索轻量级提示工程的潜力。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5迭代优化提示，GPT-4.1生成创意，Qwen3-8B通过Elo循环选择最佳提示。

Result: 在三个领域的36项测试中赢得25项，自动排行榜领先，但材料化学领域表现较弱。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程已能生成具有商业价值的创意，但某些领域需要更深入的领域知识。

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练文本重排器中的效果，发现知识蒸馏在有大教师模型时表现更优，否则对比学习更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练跨编码器重排器时的实际效果差异，为实践提供指导。

Method: 通过在不同大小和架构的重排器上使用两种方法训练，并使用强对比学习模型作为教师进行知识蒸馏。

Result: 知识蒸馏在有大教师模型时表现更好，尤其是跨领域任务；若教师模型能力相同，则对比学习更优。

Conclusion: 推荐在大教师模型可用时使用知识蒸馏，否则选择对比学习。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统探索如何充分释放LLMs和RLLMs在金融领域的潜力。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs评估提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法的效果。

Result: 提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链思维提升LLMs性能；RLLMs因固有长链思维限制方法效果；多语言对齐方法对RLLMs提升有限。

Conclusion: 本研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估生成任务（如摘要）时，自动n-gram指标（如ROUGE）被广泛使用。本文系统评估了n-gram和神经指标在多语言中的有效性，发现指标对语言类型敏感，神经指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管n-gram指标在英语中被认为与人工评估相关，但其在其他语言中的适用性尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了大规模评估套件，涵盖八种语言（四种类型学家族），分析指标与人工评估的相关性。

Result: 发现n-gram指标在融合语言中与人工评估相关性较低，而神经指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更优。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在融合语言中存在局限性，建议更多投资于针对评估任务训练的神经指标。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Motivation: 解决语言模型生成不准确文本（幻觉）的问题，探索最佳微调数据以减少幻觉。

Method: 研究微调数据的真实性对长文本生成任务中幻觉的影响，比较黄金数据和模型生成数据的效果，并评估过滤策略。

Result: 微调模型生成且模型自认为真实的数据，比微调黄金数据更能减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 模型自身的判断可作为提升生成文本真实性的有效信号。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By
providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and
applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource
for the researchers who are navigating the complex landscape of LLMs in the

Motivation: 现有LLM知识编辑方法在传播关联事实的涟漪效应时难以保持逻辑一致性。

Method: 从结构化知识库中提取逻辑模式，与LLM内部逻辑对齐，动态生成和编辑逻辑关联的知识簇。

Result: 实验显示逻辑泛化能力提升30%以上，同时保持编辑可靠性和特异性。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在涟漪效应和内部逻辑一致性方面实现了新的最先进性能。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Result: LLM能可靠检测动态辩论中的共识，加入共识检测智能体可提升辩论效率和决策质量，结果接近真实决策会议。

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统能有效模拟群体决策过程，支持跨领域专家研讨会的决策支持。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Method: 通过微调和RAG方法，在教科书案例和实际案例中测试LLM性能，评估其法律推理能力。

Result: LLM能有效支持增值税任务并提供法律依据，但当前原型无法完全自动化，需进一步整合结构化背景信息。

Conclusion: LLM在税收咨询中有潜力，但需改进以处理隐式客户知识和特定上下文文档。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are

### [45] [Semantic-Augmented Latent Topic Modeling with LLM-in-the-Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08498)
*Mengze Hong,Chen Jason Zhang,Di Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了结合大型语言模型（LLMs）增强主题模型（LDA）的效果，重点关注初始化和后校正两个阶段。实验表明，LLM引导的初始化对LDA早期迭代有改进，但对收敛无影响且表现最差；而后校正则显著提升了5.86%的连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索LLMs是否能提升LDA模型的性能，特别是在初始化和后校正阶段，以验证LLMs在文本挖掘中的实际价值。

Method: 方法包括使用LLM引导的主题聚类初始化Gibbs采样算法，以及在后校正阶段应用LLMs进行优化。

Result: 结果显示LLM引导的初始化对LDA早期迭代有改进，但对收敛无影响且表现最差；后校正阶段显著提升了5.86%的连贯性。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLM在主题模型中的实际效果有限，挑战了LLMs总是优于传统文本挖掘方法的观点。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言情感检测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论证挖掘（AM）是一个跨学科领域，近年来因大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展而显著进步。然而，缺乏对LLMs在公开论证分类数据库中表现的研究。

Method: 使用Args.me和UKP等多样化数据集，测试了GPT、Llama、DeepSeek等模型，并评估了结合Chain-of-Thoughts算法的推理增强版本。

Result: ChatGPT-4o在论证分类基准中表现最佳，而Deepseek-R1在推理增强模型中表现最优。但仍存在常见错误。

Conclusion: 该研究首次对LLMs在论证数据集上的表现进行了广泛分析，揭示了已知提示算法的弱点，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Motivation: 探索ASR转录错误对说话人归属任务的影响，填补了现有研究主要依赖人工转录的空白。

Method: 通过比较ASR转录和人工转录的数据，分析转录错误对说话人归属性能的影响。

Result: ASR转录的错误对说话人归属性能影响较小，且ASR转录可能优于人工转录。

Conclusion: ASR转录在说话人归属任务中表现良好，甚至可能优于人工转录，因为转录错误可能捕捉到说话人的特定特征。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

TL;DR: KELPS是一种新型神经符号框架，用于将非正式数学转化为机器可验证的定理，解决了多语言平行语料库的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在形式化非正式数学时因语料库数量和质量受限而面临的瓶颈。

Method: 提出KELPS框架，通过知识方程（KEs）将自然语言转化为目标形式语言（如Lean、Coq、Isabelle），并保持句法和语义一致性。

Result: 生成了60,000多个问题的平行语料库，在MiniF2F上达到88.9%的句法准确率，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: KELPS框架在形式化数学任务中表现出色，为相关领域提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参数更新的动态知识图谱增强框架（KGA），通过内外聚合路径实现实时知识融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有知识图谱增强方法依赖参数微调导致的灾难性遗忘和静态框架难以适应实时知识更新的问题。

Method: 设计了知识图谱引导注意力模块（KGA），包含外向聚合（动态融合外部知识）和内向聚合（过滤任务无关信号）。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的优异知识融合性能。

Conclusion: KGA框架实现了无需参数更新的实时知识融合，显著提升了模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Conclusion: MM-Coder通过整合文本和视觉设计，旨在革新工业编程，使LLMs能够理解和实现复杂规范。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Result: 实验表明，该方法改善了推理结构和任务性能，且比连续干预技术更高效稳定。

Conclusion: 缓存导向是一种更鲁棒、实用的可控生成解决方案。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了性能。通过数据驱动初始化改进收敛和最终表现。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域转移问题，利用预训练和微调激活的约束关系，闭式估计权重，支持可变秩初始化。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准和数据驱动初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA提供更快收敛和更高性能的初始化方案，设计选择通过分析验证。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升多层极限学习机在自然信号（如图像）分类中的性能，特别是在无人机应用中的主动分类任务。

Result: 在基准和实际无人机实验中，HML-ELM表现优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效的图像分类方法，尤其适用于无人机任务。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Conclusion: 算法在非高斯噪声下仍有一定效果，但表现可能不如高斯噪声情况。进一步研究在不同场景下的适用性仍有挑战。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

Method: 采用基于边界框检测和回归的深度学习模型，使用多洲城市数据集进行训练和交叉验证。

Result: 模型在欧洲城市表现优异（MAE约2.20米），但在亚洲城市泛化能力稍弱。

Conclusion: 深度学习在高分辨率SAR图像建筑高度估计中具有显著潜力，尤其在跨城市和跨洲泛化方面。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS提出了一种基于3D高斯配准的框架，用于重建无位姿稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合3DGS配准模块，实现了高保真度的局部高斯配准和高质量新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，且前馈高斯方法受限于输入格式，难以整合更多视图。RegGS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法求解最优传输MW2距离，设计联合3DGS配准模块，整合MW2距离、光度一致性和深度几何。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真度的局部高斯配准，精确的位姿估计和高质量新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS通过全局一致的3D高斯表示，有效解决了稀疏视图重建问题，为3D场景重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态物体或完全可见的动态主体，在遮挡场景中表现不佳。

Method: 利用模态补全推断遮挡区域，结合时间上下文增强视频序列的一致性，无需预定义模板。

Result: 在单目视频上验证，3D高斯泼溅技术显示优于现有方法，处理遮挡和时间稳定性更精确。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Hartley变换的HNOSeg-XS架构，用于医学图像分割，解决了CNN和Transformer在长距离空间相关性和计算效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中存在计算成本高、内存占用大或分辨率适应性差的问题。

Method: 通过可学习的偏微分方程建模图像分割，利用Fourier神经算子的零样本超分辨率特性，并改用Hartley变换在频域中重新表述问题。

Result: HNOSeg-XS在多个数据集上表现出色，参数少于34.7k，推理时间快（<0.24秒），内存效率高（<1.8 GiB）。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种分辨率鲁棒、高效且参数精简的医学图像分割模型。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Conclusion: 可解释的实例表面模型可有效学习，且与实例成员关系结合良好。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of

Result: PBL的关节角度误差在3度以内，步态指标可靠且敏感，能反映临床差异，如与mJOA评分相关。

Conclusion: PBL为临床提供了可扩展的运动监测工具，支持智能手机视频作为生物力学数据的有效来源。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

Motivation: 随着SAR分辨率的提升，散射特性差异增大，导致目标检测模型的泛化能力下降。现有域适应技术存在盲特征适应和不可靠语义传播的问题。

Method: CR-Net包含结构诱导的层次特征适应（SHFA）模块和可靠结构邻接对齐（RSAA）模块，分别实现结构感知的特征适应和可靠的语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中显著提升了域适应性能，并达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和提升判别能力，有效解决了跨分辨率SAR目标检测中的挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

*Ravi Shankar Prasad,Dinesh Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积Siamese网络的颅骨X射线图像与面部图像匹配框架，用于法医科学中的颅面重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法医科学中颅面重建对犯罪和灾难受害者身份识别至关重要，需利用计算机视觉技术（如深度学习）实现颅骨与面部图像的匹配。

Method: 使用卷积Siamese网络，通过最小化相似对的欧氏距离和最大化不相似对的欧氏距离，学习跨域身份表示。数据集包含40名志愿者的颅骨X射线和面部图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在颅骨识别任务中取得了令人满意的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为法医颅面重建提供了一种有效的解决方案，验证了Siamese网络在跨域匹配中的潜力。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释性的剪枝框架，减少模型复杂度同时保持预测性能和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得显著进展，但模型体积大和缺乏透明度限制了其临床应用。

Method: 利用DL-Backtrace、Layer-wise Relevance Propagation和Integrated Gradients等技术，选择性保留每层最相关的部分，实现针对性压缩。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗场景中轻量级、可解释模型的部署提供了可能。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

TL;DR: CoCo-Bot是一种后处理、可组合的概念瓶颈生成模型，通过显式概念传递所有信息，无需辅助线索，提高了可控性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成概念瓶颈模型依赖辅助视觉线索，损害了可解释性和组合性，因此需要一种无需辅助线索的模型。

Method: 提出CoCo-Bot，基于扩散能量函数，支持后处理干预（如概念组合和否定），仅通过显式概念传递信息。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ预训练的StyleGAN2上实验，CoCo-Bot在保持视觉质量的同时，提升了概念级可控性和可解释性。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，显著提升了生成模型的可解释性和组合性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法主要针对单一癌症类型，缺乏跨癌症泛化能力，而临床实践中需要更稳健的模型。

Method: 提出了两个模块：SDIR（通过稀疏化和稳定化增强弱模态信号）和CADE（在潜在空间中融合局部形态和全局基因表达）。

Result: 在四种癌症类型的基准测试中表现出优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且稳健的基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Method: 结合卷积的局部邻域接收特性和Transformer的全局依赖建模，引入多粒度信息，设计角度-范数解耦损失约束生成隐写图像。

Result: MRAG在实验中表现出色，实现了优异的秘密恢复性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗攻击，显著提升了深度隐写的抗检测能力。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

*Shishuai Hu,Zehui Liao,Liangli Zhen,Huazhu Fu,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Cycle Context Verification (CCV)框架，通过自验证预测和增强上下文对齐，提升基于ICL的医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL在医学图像分割中表现敏感于查询图像与上下文图像-掩码对的对齐，而临床场景中标注数据稀缺，难以选择最优上下文对。

Method: CCV采用循环流程：首先生成分割掩码，交换查询与上下文对角色验证预测，并通过查询特定提示优化对齐。

Result: 在七个数据集上验证，CCV优于现有方法，提升了ICL分割的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CCV为通用医学图像分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多模态大语言模型（如ChatGPT-4o）在静态行车记录图像中执行类似人类的交通场景解释能力，重点关注交通密度、交叉口可见性和停车标志识别任务。提示设计显著影响性能，多提示策略提升表现，但模型在模糊场景中仍存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在交通场景解释中的潜力，尤其是针对老年驾驶员评估的相关任务，以提升驾驶风险评估的辅助工具。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，评估模型在交通密度、交叉口可见性和停车标志识别任务中的表现，以人类标注为参考标准。

Result: 多提示策略显著提升性能（如交叉口可见性召回率从21.7%升至57.0%），但模型在模糊场景中表现不稳定。停车标志检测精度高（86.3%），但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 通过优化提示设计，大语言模型有望成为驾驶风险评估的辅助工具，未来需进一步研究更大数据集和下一代模型架构。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

strengths and limitations. We then present an in-depth overview of unsupervised
methods, categorise by their fundamental approaches, including domain
translation, self-supervision signal design and blind spot or noise-based
methods. We also provide a categorization of loss functions employed in
unsupervised video restoration and enhancement, and discuss the role of paired
synthetic datasets in enabling objective evaluation. Finally, we identify key

Result: 在图像质量和GEFU任务（分类、检测、语义分割）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEFU范式显著提升了低光视觉任务的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: ODOR数据集为艺术对象检测和视觉文化遗产研究提供了新挑战，尤其是对象识别与嗅觉感知的交叉研究。

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在保持主题一致性的同时牺牲姿势和布局多样性的问题。

Method: 采用身份传输（IT）和身份细化（IR）两阶段策略，分别处理早期和后期去噪步骤。

Result: 在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CoDi在视觉感知和性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Motivation: 现有方法需要针对不同任务设计特定架构或进行领域微调，PanMatch旨在通过统一框架解决多任务匹配问题。

Method: 提出基于2D位移估计的统一框架，利用跨领域特征提取器和大型视觉模型的特征，构建多任务数据集进行预训练。

Result: PanMatch在多领域任务中表现优异，超越UniMatch和Flow-Anything，并在异常场景下实现零样本性能。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了统一模型在多任务匹配中的潜力，尤其在跨领域和异常场景下表现突出。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

Conclusion: SHC通过语义哈希中心有效提升了哈希码的判别性，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有提示学习方法在未见类别的泛化能力和跨模态对齐方面存在不足，限制了模型性能。

Method: MuGCP利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示，引入注意力互导模块生成视觉条件提示，并通过多重提示融合机制整合不同提示。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过条件提示生成和跨模态交互，有效提升了视觉语言模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

TL;DR: InstaScene提出了一种新的3D感知范式，旨在分解复杂场景中的实例并实现完整重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能自然识别和补全遮挡物体，但机器人缺乏类似能力，现有技术无法从部分观察中识别完整物体。

Method: 采用空间对比学习追踪实例的栅格化，并结合原位生成利用几何线索指导3D生成模型。

Result: 在复杂场景分解和物体补全实验中表现优异，实现了高精度分解和几何完整的物体重建。

Conclusion: InstaScene为复杂场景的3D感知提供了有效解决方案，兼具分解精度和重建完整性。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

*Wongi Jeong,Kyungryeol Lee,Hoigi Seo,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RALU的训练免费框架，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器虽在高保真图像和视频生成中表现优异，但计算量大阻碍实际部署。现有加速方法主要利用时间维度，而RALU则专注于空间维度加速。

Method: RALU采用混合分辨率采样，分三个阶段：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节细化，并通过噪声时间步重调度稳定分辨率转换。

Result: RALU在FLUX上实现7.0倍加速，在Stable Diffusion 3上实现3.0倍加速，且图像质量退化最小。

Conclusion: RALU不仅高效，还能与现有时间加速方法互补，进一步降低推理延迟而不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Result: 方法在几何保真度和外观一致性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效解决复杂场景中修复不一致的问题，生成更真实的3D修复结果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Motivation: 探索预训练视觉基础模型的新方向，构建高效图像分词器，填补该领域研究空白。

Method: 采用冻结视觉基础模型作为编码器，引入区域自适应量化框架和语义重建目标。

Result: VFMTok在图像重建和生成质量上显著提升，gFID达2.07，加速模型收敛三倍，无需CFG即可实现高保真类别条件合成。

Conclusion: VFMTok通过创新设计提升了图像分词器的效率和性能，为社区提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Motivation: 传统3D重建方法（如SfM和MVS）存在计算成本高、鲁棒性差等问题，深度学习为这一领域带来了新突破。

Method: 前馈模型通过统一网络直接从图像中联合推断相机位姿和密集几何结构，采用Transformer建模对应关系，并扩展到多视图场景。

Result: 新模型简化了工作流程，提高了效率，但在动态场景和模型精度方面仍需改进。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的3D重建具有广泛应用前景，但需解决精度、可扩展性和动态场景处理等挑战。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将文档识别视为转录任务的新视角，通过设计结构特定的归纳偏置和基础Transformer架构，成功应用于复杂文档类型（如工程图纸）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档识别方法忽视文档类型特定的结构属性，依赖次优启发式后处理，限制了复杂文档类型的识别能力。

Method: 提出一种方法，设计结构特定的归纳偏置，并基于Transformer架构实现端到端文档识别系统。

Result: 通过实验验证了该方法在复杂文档类型（如乐谱、形状图纸和工程图纸）中的有效性，首次实现了工程图纸的端到端转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计未来文档基础模型提供了统一框架，尤其适用于非标准文档类型的识别。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Motivation: 解决临床医学图像分割中多模态输入不完整、泛化性差和任务特异性窄的问题，提升模型在真实场景中的适用性。

Method: 采用灵活合成模态训练和零图像策略，无需显式合成网络即可处理缺失模态，支持多病理分割且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: F3-Net是一种通用且可扩展的解决方案，弥合了深度学习研究与临床实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a
versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research

Conclusion: D2Dewarp通过双维度感知和特征互补，显著提升了文档去扭曲的准确性，同时公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

Conclusion: OGFR通过知识蒸馏和特征净化，显著提升了遮挡行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注的查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 使用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，同时引入解剖位置嵌入（APE）丰富表示。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上的实验表明，放射组学特征显著提高了检索特异性，APE为基于位置的搜索提供了全局解剖背景。

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval框架仅需最小用户提示（如单点），支持多样化的临床场景，具有诊断、治疗规划和大规模医学影像研究的潜力。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

Motivation: 解决现有无配对图像翻译方法无法保证语义匹配的问题，特别是在语义分割任务中，噪声像素标签会影响性能。

Method: 提出DA-KPN，通过估计像素级输入变换参数，结合多尺度判别器确保翻译的逼真性。

Result: 在合成到真实数据的语义分割任务中表现优于现有GAN方法，在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN在低数据量下有效解决了语义匹配问题，提升了语义分割性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中达到SOTA性能，显著提升实例类别表现。

Conclusion: DISC通过分离优化实例和场景上下文，显著提升了3D语义场景补全的精度和效率。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

Abstract: This study aims to develop a novel multi-modal fusion framework for brain
tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through
bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy
and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal
Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text
descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional
Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset
comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method
achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BayesTTA方法，解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的适应问题，通过贝叶斯框架实现预测一致性和动态表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在时间演化分布偏移下表现不佳，存在记忆限制、置信度不可靠和表示不对齐等问题。

Method: BayesTTA采用贝叶斯框架，增量估计类条件高斯混合分布，自适应选择协方差结构，并通过GDA进行校准推理。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了时间演化分布偏移下的适应问题，具有高效性和稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

TL;DR: NeuralOS是一个神经框架，通过直接预测屏幕帧来模拟操作系统的图形用户界面（GUI），结合RNN和扩散渲染器，能生成逼真的GUI序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为未来人机交互系统创建完全自适应的生成神经界面。

Method: 结合RNN跟踪计算机状态和扩散渲染器生成屏幕图像，使用Ubuntu XFCE录制的大规模数据集训练。

Result: 成功渲染逼真的GUI序列，准确捕捉鼠标交互，可靠预测状态转换（如应用启动）。

Conclusion: 尽管精确模拟键盘交互仍有挑战，但NeuralOS为未来自适应神经界面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

Motivation: 研究如何通过最小化训练数据和标注工作量，高效转录手写文档。

Method: 使用DAN模型，在两种不同标注方法的数据集上进行实验。

Result: 标准化标注对可标准化字段（如日期、出生地）更有效，而外交标注对不可标准化字段（如姓名）表现更好。

Conclusion: 标注策略应根据字段类型选择，以提高手写文档转录的准确性。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

*Junho Koh,Youngwoo Lee,Jungho Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Jun Won Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OnlineBEV提出了一种基于循环结构的时间3D感知方法，通过MBFNet实现特征对齐，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多帧BEV特征的动态变化限制了时间聚合的性能提升，需要一种有效的方法对齐特征。

Method: 使用循环结构结合BEV特征，MBFNet提取运动特征并动态对齐历史与当前特征，辅以时间一致性学习损失。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过时间特征对齐和循环结构，显著提升了相机3D感知性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DatasetAgent的多智能体协作系统，通过协调四个不同智能体和多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），自动从真实世界图像中构建高质量数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像数据集构建依赖耗时且低效的人工收集和标注，而生成数据虽能提供解决方案，但真实世界数据更具价值。

Method: 利用多智能体协作系统和MLLMs，结合图像优化工具包，根据用户需求自动构建数据集。

Result: 实验表明，DatasetAgent能有效扩展现有数据集和从零创建新数据集，并用于训练多种视觉模型。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent为高效构建高质量图像数据集提供了新方法，尤其在真实世界数据场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

### [110] [Generalizable 7T T1-map Synthesis from 1.5T and 3T T1 MRI with an Efficient Transformer Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08655)
*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Tonghe Wang,Vanessa Wildman,David S. Yu,Hui Mao,Erik Middlebrooks,Aparna Kesewala,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的7T-Restormer模型，用于从1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI分辨率高但成本昂贵且稀缺，希望通过合成技术使其更适用于临床。

Method: 使用141例患者数据训练和验证模型，比较了7T-Restormer与ResViT和ResShift的性能。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，参数更少且误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床提供了高质量的7T MRI替代方案，提升了7T MRI的可及性。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ByDeWay是一个无需训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）增强框架，采用分层深度提示（LDP）策略，通过深度感知的上下文提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升MLLM的空间推理和接地能力，减少幻觉现象，同时无需修改模型参数。

Method: 使用单目深度估计将场景分为近、中、远三层，生成区域特定描述，并将其附加到图像-问题提示中。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，多个MLLM性能均得到提升。

Conclusion: 深度感知提示在零训练设置下有效，方法轻量且兼容黑盒模型。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

TL;DR: MoSAiC框架通过联合优化多模态对比学习和多标签监督对比损失，提升了地球系统观测中的语义解耦和表示学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球系统观测（ESO）中多模态卫星图像的高类间相似性和复杂场景导致表示学习困难，现有对比学习框架缺乏多标签对齐和跨模态语义精确性。

Method: 提出MoSAiC框架，结合了模态内和模态间对比学习，并引入多标签监督对比损失。

Result: 在BigEarthNet V2.0和Sent12MS数据集上，MoSAiC在低标签和高类重叠场景中优于全监督和自监督基线。

Conclusion: MoSAiC为多模态卫星图像的表示学习提供了更鲁棒和语义精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于关键点跟踪的无训练分割方法，用于MRI肌肉分割，性能接近CNN模型，但计算成本更低且更易解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI肌肉分割方法依赖大量数据和计算资源，且对小肌肉分割准确性不足。

Method: 结合关键点选择和Lucas-Kanade光流技术，实现无训练分割。

Result: 平均Dice相似系数为0.6-0.7，性能接近CNN模型，计算需求显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床和研究提供了一种高效、可解释的肌肉分割解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级CLIP（L-CLIP）的新型嵌入式字幕评估指标L-CLIPScore，用于高效评估字幕质量和训练字幕模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统字幕评估指标效率低和资源消耗大的问题，同时提升多模态对齐能力。

Method: 通过权重复用和矩阵分解压缩CLIP架构，并设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行知识蒸馏。

Result: L-CLIP在减少计算资源和时间的同时，保持了与原始CLIP相当的多模态对齐能力。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore在评估字幕质量时高效有效，但训练字幕模型时需与n-gram指标混合使用以避免训练失败。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

Result: 在多个数字病理数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现出色，提高了预测的可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: SGPMIL通过概率建模和特征缩放，显著提升了MIL框架的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集在场景复杂性、分辨率和多样性方面存在不足，限制了多摄像头车辆跟踪研究的实际应用。

Method: 通过四个非重叠的高分辨率摄像头（4K，15fps）采集40分钟标记视频，包含512辆车的跨摄像头关联数据，并提供子任务数据集。

Result: 数据集包含丰富的挑战（如遮挡和非线性运动），并提供基线结果和评估代码。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD填补了学术研究与实际场景之间的差距，支持多摄像头车辆跟踪及相关任务的研究。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据不足的情况下表现优异，尤其是CT图像中的精细STV尺度对PET高摄取预测具有显著指示作用。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Motivation: 现有交通数字孪生依赖静态地图或昂贵传感器，缺乏可扩展性和适应性，且多源数据处理面临隐私和效率挑战。

Method: 提出Geo-ORBIT框架，包含轻量级车道检测模型GeoLane，并通过Meta-GeoLane和FedMeta-GeoLane实现本地化和联邦学习优化。

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在多样城市场景中表现优于基线方法，几何误差更低，泛化能力更强，通信开销大幅减少。

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT为灵活、上下文感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础，框架已开源。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

TL;DR: Birkhoff是一种新型的无数据压缩算法，用于Segment Anything Model (SAM)及其变体，具有高效、通用和紧凑的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中的优异表现，压缩这些模型成为迫切需求。

Method: 提出Hyper-Compression算法和HyperLinear算子，将高维参数向量压缩为低维标量，并加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Birkhoff在压缩时间、压缩比、性能和推理速度上表现优异。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的压缩方法，适用于SAM及其变体，且无需微调数据。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Result: 模型在10,000张MNIST测试图像上达到99.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 深度特征提取和原型覆盖对高性能至关重要，模型可推广至其他模式识别任务。

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分感知的扩散框架，显著提升了3D生成的细节、部分独立性和可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Motivation: 解决场景渲染中数据量大、计算效率低的问题，同时保持丰富的几何和外观信息。

Method: 使用多视图编码器将图像和相机姿态转换为令牌，通过K-means聚类选择关键光线，构建压缩光场令牌（CLiFTs），并利用计算自适应渲染器合成新视图。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV数据集上验证了方法的有效性，实现了数据量显著减少的同时保持可比的渲染质量，并提供了数据大小、渲染质量和速度的权衡。

Conclusion: CLiFTs方法在高效渲染和灵活性方面表现出色，为场景表示和渲染提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成器存在架构不统一、依赖外部编码器或延迟高的问题，Lumos-1旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用3D RoPE和MM-RoPE技术增强时空建模，提出AR-DF策略平衡帧间损失，并优化训练效率。

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练的Lumos-1性能与多个基准模型相当。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过改进架构和训练策略，实现了高效且高质量的自回归视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/Lumos.
